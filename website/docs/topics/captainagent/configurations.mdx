# Details of all the available configurations
Captain Agent requires `nested_mode_config` for configuration. Below is an example, we will break it down and provide a detailed explanation.

```
nested_mode_config = {
    "autobuild_init_config": {
        "config_file_or_env": "OAI_CONFIG_LIST",
        "builder_model": "gpt-4-1106-preview",
        "agent_model": "gpt-4-1106-preview",
    },
    # this is used to configure the autobuild building process
    "autobuild_build_config": {
        "default_llm_config": {"temperature": 1, "top_p": 0.95, "max_tokens": 1500, "seed": 52},
        # this is used to configure the user proxy within nested chat
        "code_execution_config": {"timeout": 300, "work_dir": "groupchat", "last_n_messages": 1},
        "coding": True,
        "library_path_or_json": "captainagent_expert_library.json",
    },
    # this is used to configure the tool library
    "autobuild_tool_config": {
        "tool_root": "default",  # this will use the tool library we provide
        "retriever": "all-mpnet-base-v2",
    },
    # this is used to configure the group chat
    "group_chat_config": {"max_round": 15},
    "group_chat_llm_config": general_llm_config.copy(),
}
